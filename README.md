# Malaria_detection_with_Virus_Positioning

Developed a malaria detector using TensorFlow's Sequential model API, featuring convolutional and dense layers to achieve high accuracy. For further enhancement, the implementation can be adapted to the Functional API for greater flexibility in building complex models and handling multiple inputs and outputs.
